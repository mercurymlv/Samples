# Samples
Sample code for employer view on 3 different platforms: SQL, Python/Pandas, and Alteryx.

Also included are sample busienss process diagrams.

These files were originally created to pull data from secure databases to which I no longer have access. However, they will give you a good idea of my skill level. I put an emphasis on good structure and proper commenting.

In particular, these will be of interest:

SQL/DPM_Primary_CDC_new_30May19.sql - A very complex SQL statement which I used to create a "one stop shop" report for many different business teams. The query utilizes many different nested subqueries and tricky solutions to build conditions for selection. The reason for the complexity is that I wanted to provide data to the users in a way that was easily consumble by a non-tech, non-data audience. The approach was very popular. 

Python/RDC_Xdock_Validation.ipynb - a small Python script to check for errors and mis-aligned data in one of our tables that was core to scheduling 10k to 100k orders in our Order Management process. This script demonstrates familiarity with Python and use of the vectorization capibilities of Pandas and NumPy to efficiently parse the large data set and gain fast insight.
